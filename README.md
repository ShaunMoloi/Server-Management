PART 1:
1) Write a Dockerfile (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#shell) that has/does the following:
    
    2) It should be built from CentOS-7
    
    3) Update the OS
    
    4) Install conda using miniconda (doing this through Anaconda is cheating)
    
        5) Install python 3.5+ using conda
    
        6) Install Jupyter using conda
    
        7) Install pandas library and it's dependencies using conda
    
    8) Include the csv file in the container.
    
    9) Include the pandas_notebook that was provided in the home directory.
    
    9) SET the enviroment variable $CSV_FILE_DIR to point to the directory you put the csv file in
    
    10) Run jupyter in no-browser mode (hint: use TINI)    
        - the jupyter UI should be served on port 9000

11) Build your Dockerfile    

From your terminal run: docker -it -p 9000:9000 <tag of your image>    
Access jupyter from your local machine. (Hint: use chrome) 
Run the pandas_notebook in jupyter

PART 2:  
Back in your Dockerfile    
1) Install spark-standalone and all dependencies.
    - make sure you can import the pyspark libraries from within a jupyter notebook
2) Include the spark_notebook that was provided in the home directory.
From your terminal run: docker -it -p 9000:9000 <tag of your image>    
Access jupyter from your local machine. (Hint: use chrome) 
Run the spark_notebook in jupyter

PART 3: 

Some ideas:
* Get hadoop + spark working
